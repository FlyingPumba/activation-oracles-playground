  warnings.warn("Can't initialize NVML")
I must not hide failures or bloat my code.
Try-except and bloat are the twin deaths - correctness and clarity-killer.
The little lies and excesses that bring total obliteration.
I will face my crashes. I will resist my urge to comment and over-engineer.
Let failures speak loud, let simplicity flow through me.
Assert shapes, face errors, permit only what is essential.
And when temptation passes, where hiding and bloating lived there will be nothing.
Only minimal, debuggable truth will remain.
